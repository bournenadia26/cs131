This is the repo I made for CS-131: Processing Big Data - Tools and Techniques, a class I took at SJSU in Spring 2025. 
During the class, I uploaded the csv files we were given here so I could turn them into dataframes to work with in Python.
Later, I uploaded the ipynb files that contained the ML models I created.
